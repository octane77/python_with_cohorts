2.1 (What does this code do?) Create the variables x = 2 and y = 3, then determine what
each of the following statements displays:
a) print('x =', x) x = 2
b) print('Value of', x, '+', x, 'is', (x + x)) Value of 2 + 2 is 4
c) print('x =') x =
d) print((x + y), '=', (y + x)) 5 = 5

2.2 (Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?) The following code should read an integer into the
variable rating:
rating = input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10: ')

2.3 (Fill in the missing code) Replace *** in the following code with a statement that
will print a message like 'Congratulations! Your grade of 91 earns you an A in this
course'. Your statement should print the value stored in the variable grade:
if grade >= 90:
    print("Congratulations! A grade greater than 90 earns you an A in this course")
