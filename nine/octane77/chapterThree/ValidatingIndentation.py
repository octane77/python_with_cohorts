# # 3.23 (Validating Indentation) The file validate_indents.py in this chapter’s ch03 examples
# # folder contains the following code with incorrect indentation:
# #
# import tabnanny
# grade = 93
# if grade >= 90:
# print('A')
# print('Great Job!')
# print('Take a break from studying')
#
#
# # The Python Standard Library includes a code indentation validator module named
# # tabnanny, which you can run as a script to check your code for proper indentation—this
# # is one of many static code analysis tools. Execute the following command in the ch03
# # folder to see the results of analyzing validate_indents.py:
# # python -m tabnanny validate_indents.py
# # Suppose you accidentally aligned the second print statement under the i in the if keyword.
# # What kind of error would that be? Would you expect tabnanny to flag that as an
# # error?
