# 3.17 (Nested Loops) Write a script that displays the following triangle patterns separately,
# one below the other. Separate each pattern from the next by one blank line. Use for
# loops to generate the patterns. Display all asterisks (*) with a single statement of the form
# print('*', end='')
# which causes the asterisks to display side by side. [Hint: For the last two patterns, begin
# each line with zero or more space characters.]
